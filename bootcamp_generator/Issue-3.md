# <UNAME> - Introduction to TheSyDeKick-Part-3 

After closing Introduction to TheSyDeKick-Part-2, study the structure of Entities/inverter_testbench
and Entities/inverter_tests. Execute the simulation for both. Try to understand
the relation of inverter, testbench and tests. Why the self test of the
inverter is not sufficient for everything?

This is the basis of the TheSyDeKick system verifications.
