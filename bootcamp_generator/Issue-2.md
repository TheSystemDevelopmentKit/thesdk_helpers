# <UNAME> - Introduction to TheSyDeKick-Part-2 

After closing Introduction to TheSyDeKick-Part-1  , Read through documentation at
https://thesystemdevelopmentkit.github.io/docs/index.html and try out the
inverter simulations with various models. Study the inverter code a bit. That
gives some idea how TheSyDeKick supports multiple simulators and the formalism
of IO and execution constructs.
