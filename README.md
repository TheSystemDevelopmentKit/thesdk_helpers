# Collection of helper scripts for TheSyDeKick

Shell directory is for unix shell scripts.

Directory thesdk\_helpers directory is for python modules, if needed. In this case thesdk_helpers 
should be also linked to Entities directory. 

## Shell
- initentity.sh creates an new entity from a template
- pip3userinstall.sh installs the required Python dependencies for TheSyDeKck

Developers guideline: All scripts (should) provide help and description with option -h
